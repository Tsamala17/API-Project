this is my first project about using API for get more information about diferent species of animals.
json and sqlite files are done by concrete example of animal and API.py file is adjustable for any type of animal (animals whose information is avaliable in this web api)

now i want to talk about how to use my project. There are some nuances. this code need some aspects to work correctly:
1. in this code are two user input valiables, when u select animal name in the first variable, then u must select the one species of first selected animal.
   for example:  if u select 'LION' in first user-input, then u must select lion's species in second user-input (for exaple: mountain lion or cave lion)
